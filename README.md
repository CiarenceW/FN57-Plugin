# FN57-Plugin
A Five-seveN gun mod for Receiver 2

Also check out: [MagLoaderThing](https://github.com/CiarenceW/MagLoaderThing), this un-cuts a thing in the Compound that makes reloading big magazines a breeze  

And [this](https://github.com/CiarenceW/r2_CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes) as well, it adds ammo boxes for modded cartridges in the Compound, with possibilities of adding custom models for them too (like this gun has)
